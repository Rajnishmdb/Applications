            <ul>
                <li>ALL PHASES OF MANUFACTURING OR CONSTRUCTION REQUIRE THE CONVERSION OF NEW IDEAS AND DESIGN CONCEPTS INTO THE BASIC LINE LANGUAGE OF GRAPHICS.
                    THEREFORE, THERE ARE MANY AREAS (CIVIL, MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, ARCHITECTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL) IN WHICH THE SKILLS OF THE CAD TECHNICIANS PLAY
                    MAJOR ROLES IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR CONSTRUCTION. STUDENTS PREPARE FOR ACTUAL WORK SITUATIONS THROUGH PRACTICAL TRAINING
                    IN A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART COMPUTER DESIGNED CAD LABORATORY USING ENGINEERING SOFTWARE.</li>
